# Model-Extraction-with-RL
ECSE 6962 - Trustworthy Machine Learning Course Project: Model Extraction attacks via Active RL policies

Requirements: under requirements.txt

To replicate results: 
  1. run experiments/active_learning_baseline.py to find the performance of baseline methods (both Extended Adaptive Re-training and Adaptive Re-training methods).
  2. run experiments/lowd_meek.py to find the performance of the second baseline method that is based on generalized binary search.
  3. run experiments/active_learning_via_RL.py to find the performance of the proposed "Active Learning via Reinforcement Learning Policies" method.

Please feel to reach out to "dwivea2" at "rpi.edu" if you have any questions or want to collaborate further on this project.

The code for the baselines are built upon the original contributor that can be found on: https://github.com/ftramer/Steal-ML
